## Summary
**T**his app is about doing rudimentary debugging on already existing application written by a different developer and adding the final polish to an app before release.  Additional features are added like a widget, graphs of stock data, and persisting stocks to display how they’ve changed over time.  There are a number of libraries used in this app and I’m not fond of all of them, but using software selected by a different developer was an import part of this project.


## Specifications
**Common Requirements**  
•  Follow Java style guide, git style guide, [core app quality guide][1], and [tablet app quality guide][2].  

**Required Components**  
•  Each stock quote on the main screen is clickable and leads to a new screen which graphs the stock's value over time.  
•  Stock Hawk does not crash when a user searches for a non-existent stock.  
•  Stock Hawk Stocks can be displayed in a collection widget.  
•  Stock Hawk app has content descriptions for all buttons for accessibility support.  
•  Stock Hawk app supports layout mirroring using both the RTL attribute and the start/end tags.  
•  Strings are all included in the strings.xml file and untranslatable strings have a translatable tag marked to false.  

**Libraries**  
•  App using previously selected libraries for development to handle networking, data persistence, and user interface.  


## Issues
•  Demo videos, images, and links to download app are forthcoming.  
•  API may or may not still be functional.  
•  Repo should be merged with the other demo applications for convenience.  
•  Upload Java style guide used.  
•  Upload Git style guide used.
